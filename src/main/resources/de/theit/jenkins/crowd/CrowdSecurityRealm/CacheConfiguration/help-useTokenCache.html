    Enable this option to cache the Crowd SSO authentication token validity for the duration of the cache records timeout (TTL).
    This can <strong>significantly</strong> improve overall performance.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Important:</strong> While other caches create delayed propagation of user changes in Crowd, 
    enabling this option will delay even the Crowd user being disabled or the Crowd application 
    being disabled from being enforced for the duration of the Cache TTL.
